### ‚öôÔ∏è Frontend Behavior & Assumptions

- The application is made slightly responsive for mobile devices. 
- When the dataset becomes crowded, especially with **callout lines**, they are displayed **only on hover** under certain conditions to keep the UI clean.
- In bar chart segments:
  - If the figure (label/value) is **too small to display clearly**, it is **intentionally hidden** to avoid visual clutter.
  - This behavior is based on visual clarity assumptions made during development.
